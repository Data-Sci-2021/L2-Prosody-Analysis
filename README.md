## L2-Prosody-Analysis

1.Overview  
--------------------------------------------------------------   
This is Miroo Lee's project repo for Data Science (LING 2340). The goal of this project is to investigate how L2 learners' speech develop rhythmic properties of prosody by examining temporal modifications of phonetic segments as a function of lexical stress and domain-initial boundary lengthening.   

2.Dataset 
--------------------------------------------------------------   
The data set I started my project with comes from the PELIC speech corpus from the University of Pittsburgh. The PELIC speech corpus is a large learner corpus, and the current project examined 2-minute semi-spontaneous monologues by Korean students. You can find more information about the corpus from [here](https://eli-data-mining-group.github.io/Pitt-ELI-Corpus/).
