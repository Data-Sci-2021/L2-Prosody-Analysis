Created wav folder where future audio files will be uploaded. Created a note that records data processing on PELIC\_speech\_compiled.csv which is a compilation of the PELIC speech data. Currently, PELIC speech data nor PELIC\_speech\_compiled.csv is available for public access. However, I got a permission to publish subset of the PELIC speech data (and corresponding file information)

## 1st progress report

Completed data processing note on PELIC\_speech\_compiled.csv, illustrating the following steps I took to for this project.  
1. Identify Korean speakers who enrolled minimum of 3-5 levels and their 2-minute monologues. Save the information as ['korean_monologues_lv13.csv'](korean_monologues_lv13.csv).  
2. Add all the speech files from ['korean_monologues_lv13.csv'](korean_monologues_lv13.csv) to ['wav'](wav/) folder.  
3. Identify transcriptions for the corresponding audio files and save the information as ['korean_monologues_lv13_trnascription.csv'](korean_monologues_lv13_transcriptions.csv).

Now the full speech data and corresponding transcripts are available.  
Next step is to work with MFA.
